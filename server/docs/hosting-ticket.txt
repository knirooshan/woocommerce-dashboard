Subject: Hosting Requirements for Node.js + React Application

Hi,

I need to host a full-stack web application and would like to know the best hosting option from your services.

APPLICATION DETAILS:
- Frontend: React.js SPA (static files)
- Backend: Node.js 18+ with Express.js (runs on port 5000)
- Database: MongoDB (prefer local installation if available, can use Atlas as fallback)
- Users: 5-50 concurrent users expected

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Node.js version 18 or higher
- SSH/Terminal access for npm install
- Ability to run Node.js app continuously (PM2 or systemd)
- Reverse proxy support (Apache/Nginx) to forward /api requests
- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt acceptable)
- Outbound HTTPS connections to WooCommerce API
- .htaccess support OR Nginx configuration

RESOURCES NEEDED:
- RAM: 1GB minimum (2GB+ if local MongoDB)
- Storage: 1GB minimum (5-10GB if local MongoDB)
- Bandwidth: 50-100GB/month
- SSL: Required
- Database: MongoDB (local installation preferred, Atlas fallback)

QUESTIONS:

1. Which hosting plan supports Node.js 18+ applications?

2. Do you offer cPanel or DirectAdmin with Node.js setup tools?

3. Can I use PM2 for process management?

4. DATABASE (IMPORTANT):
   - Can I install MongoDB locally on the server? (This would be ideal)
   - Is MongoDB pre-installed or can I install it myself?
   - Do you offer managed MongoDB hosting?
   - If local MongoDB not available, are outbound connections to MongoDB Atlas (port 27017) allowed?
   - Which database option would you recommend for my use case?

5. What's the deployment process? (FTP, Git, SSH?)

6. Is SSL included or available?

7. What are the costs and any setup fees?

8. Do you provide technical support for Node.js deployments?

9. Are there any bandwidth/storage overage charges?

10. Do you offer automated backups?

BUDGET: $10-50/month (flexible, can go higher if local MongoDB included)

TIMELINE: Ready to deploy within 1-2 weeks

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
- Application is fully developed and tested locally
- Currently using MongoDB Atlas (free tier) but prefer local MongoDB for better performance
- WooCommerce integration requires outbound API calls
- PDF generation and image processing included
- Need ability to set environment variables securely

Please recommend the most suitable hosting plan and provide:
- Technical specifications of recommended plan
- Deployment documentation specific to your hosting
- Any limitations I should be aware of
- Pricing breakdown
- Whether local MongoDB is available/recommended

Thank you for your assistance!
